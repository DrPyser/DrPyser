Hi! I'm Charles, a Montreal-native/Montreal-based developer and tech enthusiast.
I'm currently most proficient coding in Python(~5 years of professional experience), but I also have some practical knowledge and coding experience in 
* Lisps(Scheme, Common Lisp, Racket)
* Javascript/Typescript
* Haskell
* C
* Lua.

I also have read about many other programming ecosystems and languages(e.g. Erlang, Elixir, Go, Rust, Scala, Clojure, Ruby, SmallTalk).
I'm also a fan of the functional programming paradigm and try to apply its principles as often as possible(to the extent that the language and context allows) to manage complexity and ensure reliability.
I have a particular interest in the open web, open protocols and open standards, networking, language design and developer ergonomics and decentralized systems.

I'm also passionate about learning different paradigms of programming and approaches to problems and goals within the computer/information space.
I hope to get opportunities to keep learning and integrating new practical and conceptual toolsets, as well as practicing and mastering those that I already know.

I believe in the value of open software and open collaboration in technology, both for the technology developers and owners as well as for the users(which often is pretty much everyone, as technology shapes and interacts with so much aspects of the social realities).
